# Pixel Weather

A small and compact weather widget meant for your desktop. Your location is automatically found from your IP address. The reansparent background allows it to blend in with your current setup.

There is a dark mode and a light mode, for lighter and darker backgrounds respectively. 

## To do

This project is still in its early stages. The main challenge as of now is to find a way to always keep the widget at the bottom of all other windows.

PRs welcome.
